dCC's week 3 project.  Dinosaurs VS Robots!  This is a turn based battle game designed to be played within the Python terminal.


9-9 Created all classes.  Created a herd and fleet to contain list of created dinosaurs and robots.
9-10 I created the logic for the game that I believe should work.  Unfortunatley, I wasn't able to achieve MVP (real bummer) in time to test it.  (Will have to resubmit this at a later date).
I kept getting tripped up on adding a weapon to the robots, then decided to scrap it entirely and just add an attack value instead, but have messed some things up in the process.
I think just have to tweak a few things to ahcieve MVP but I believe the foundation is there.
